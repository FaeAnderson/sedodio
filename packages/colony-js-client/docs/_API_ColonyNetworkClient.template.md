The `ColonyNetworkClient` is a standard interface for interactions with functions and events described in `IColonyNetwork.sol`.

These interactions are generally concerned with the colony network as a whole, rather than at the colony level. This includes operations like getting a count of all colonies on the network, querying for information about a parent skillId, or deposits/withdrawals of staked CLNY for use in the reputation system.

You can learn more about the solidity implementation from the [Colony Network Docs](/colonynetwork/docs-colony).

For interactions within a particular colony, see [the ColonyClient docs](/colonyjs/api-colonyclient/).

## Creating a new instance

Assuming you're inside an `async` function:

```javascript
const networkClient = new ColonyNetworkClient({ adapter });
await networkClient.init();
```

## Instance methods

**All instance methods return promises.**

### `createToken({ name, symbol, decimals })`

Deploys a new ERC20 compatible token contract for you to use with your Colony. You can also use your own token when creating a Colony.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|name|string|Name of the token to create (e.g. Cool Colony Token)|
|symbol|string|Symbol of the token to create (e.g. CCT)|
|decimals|string|Decimals of your token (default: 18).|

**Returns**

`Promise<Address>` The address of the newly deployed token contract

### `getColonyClientByAddress(contractAddress)`

Returns an initialized ColonyClient for the contract at address `contractAddress`

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|contractAddress|Adress|Address of a deployed Colony contract|

**Returns**

`Promise<ColonyClient>`. An instance of a `ColonyClient` associated with the given Colony contract

### `getColonyClient(id)`

Returns an initialized ColonyClient for the specified id of a deployed colony contract.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|key|string|Name of the Colony to get|
|id|number|Integer number of the Colony|

**Returns**

`Promise<ColonyClient>`. An instance of a `ColonyClient` associated with the given Colony contract

### `getColonyAddress(id)`

Get the address of a Colony for the specified id of a deployed colony contract.

**Arguments**

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|key|string|Name of the Colony to get|
|id|number|Integer number of the Colony|

**Returns**

`Promise<Address>`. The address of the given Colony contract

### `getMetaColonyClient()`

Gets the Meta Colony as an initialized ColonyClient

**Returns**

`Promise<ColonyClient>`. An instance of a `ColonyClient` associated with the MetaColony contract
