The `AuthorityClient` is a standard interface for interactions with functions and events described in `Authority.sol`.

In the current implementation of the Colony Network, some events on-chain are not mediated by reputation scores as described in the whitepaper. Rather, certain actions within a colony that would ordinarily require some minimum reputation are assigned an 'authority' of Colony Owner and Colony Admin. This includes colony-wide actions such as minting new colony tokens as well as the creation and finalization of tasks.

The roles of `OWNER` and `ADMIN` are able to call certain specific functions on the Colony Network, which are not permitted by addresses without an authorityRole defined.

| `createTask`                        | X             | X             |
| `cancelTask`                        | X             | X             |
| `setAdmin`                          | X             | X             |
| `removeAdmin`                       | X             |               |

Note: these authority roles are distinct from the 'roles' assigned in a task (manager, worker, and evaluator). See the [task lifecycle](/colonyjs/docs-task-lifecycle/) for a summary of task roles.
