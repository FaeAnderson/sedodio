The `ColonyClient` class is a standard interface for interactions with the on-chain functions and events described in `IColony.sol`

These interactions are generally concerned with functions and events internal to a colony, such as creating a task, assigning a work rating, or moving funds between pots.

For functions and events that concern the colonyNetwork as a whole, refer to the [ColonyNetworkClient API](/colonyjs/api-colonynetworkclient/)

## Creating a new instance

You _could_ create a ColonyClient by using an adapter and a query: `new ColonyClient({ adapter, query })` and then `.init()` it but it is advised to ask the network client for a new instance:

```javascript
const colonyClient = await networkClient.getColonyClient(colonyId); // This is already initialised
```

## Instance properties

### `authority`

The Colony's [AuthorityClient](/colonyjs/api-authorityclient/) instance.

### `token`

The Colony's [TokenClient](/colonyjs/api-tokenclient/) instance.
